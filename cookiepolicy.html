<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25/11/2025</p>

<p>
    This Cookie Policy explains how this website (“we”, “our”, “us”) uses cookies and 
    similar technologies.
</p>

<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help 
    websites function properly, enhance security, and improve user experience. Some cookies 
    are essential, meaning the website cannot operate correctly without them.
</p>

<h2>Cookies We Use</h2>

<h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
<p>We use only one essential third-party cookie that is required for our authentication workflow:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Cookie Name</th>
            <th>Provider</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
            <th>Type</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>__cf_bm</td>
            <td>orcid.org</td>
            <td>
                This cookie is set by Cloudflare to distinguish between humans and bots, 
                protect against abuse, and ensure secure authentication with ORCID. 
                It is essential for login functionality.
            </td>
            <td>~30 minutes</td>
            <td>Third-party, essential</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Non-Essential Cookies</h3>

<p>We do not use:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Analytics cookies</li>
    <li>Advertising or tracking cookies</li>
    <li>Preference or personalization cookies</li>
    <li>Any other non-essential cookies</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to Manage Cookies</h2>

<p>Because the only cookie we use is strictly necessary for security and authentication, it cannot be opted out of. If you disable all cookies through your browser, you will not be able to log in with ORCID.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.</p>
