<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Unpublished.pub</strong>! 
    Our mission is to make research more accessible, discoverable, and shareable, even when it is not formally published. 
    We provide a platform where researchers can showcase drafts, unfinished projects, ideas, and data in order to find new collaborators and show scientific works which never reached the publication stage.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We allow researchers to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Share unpublished projects, ideas, and datasets.</li>
    <li>Connect with other researchers for potential collaboration.</li>
    <li>Increase visibility of work that is not formally published.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>Science progresses faster when knowledge is shared openly. By giving researchers a safe space to share early-stage work, we hope to accelerate discovery, reduce duplication, and encourage collaboration across disciplines.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions, suggestions, or want to collaborate with us, please reach out at: info@unpublished.pub</p>
